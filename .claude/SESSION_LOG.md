# Session Log

## 2026-06-13 — Webhook ID variables + Automations sortable table
- **Task:** (1) webhooks expose more specific variable names (deliveryId,
  deliveryName, brandId, projectId); (2) render the Automations list as a
  table reusing the Model Registry pattern with sorting + on/off toggle.
- **Built (backend):** `enrich_context()` now returns
  `brandId/deliveryId/projectId` alongside the existing *Name keys (empty
  string when absent; handler drops empties); webhook default-payload
  whitelist + both approval triggers' `contextKeys` extended so the IDs
  ship by default and appear in the dialog's "Available" token hint.
- **Built (frontend):** Automations list replaced with a sortable `Table`
  (reused `ui/table` + `SortableTableHead` + `useSortableTable` — the same
  primitives the Templates/Model-Registry tables use). Columns: Name /
  Trigger (IF) / Action (THEN) / Status (sortable) + Actions; the Status
  column hosts the existing on/off `Switch`; row click still opens edit;
  delete unchanged.
- **Verified:** PHP lint clean; suite 68 tests / 221 assertions green
  (extended the enrichment-whitelist test with the 3 ids); tsc 0 errors in
  touched files (56 baseline unchanged); build clean; live wp-cli:
  enrich_context resolves brandId/deliveryId/projectId and they reach the
  webhook payload (as strings). Deploy zip rebuilt (04:07). Table sort/
  toggle is UI-only — eyeball after reload.
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-13 — Async Kie path: remaining call sites (Ads + Variations + Writer)
- **Report (deployed site):** Ads module visuals still failing with
  "API error: 500" — its orchestration (`useAdsOrchestration`) was a
  separate call site still on the blocking `/image/generate`.
- **Built:** kieai async branch in `useAdsOrchestration` (5s/12min, honors
  the orchestration's abort signal); swept ALL remaining
  `image.generate`/`editImage` consumers and ported the last two —
  `AssetDetailView/VariationsPanel` and Writer's
  `useWriterImageGeneration` — via a new shared `app/src/lib/kieTask.ts`
  `runKieTask()` helper (create→poll loop with interval/cap/transient-error
  /abort options). Every Kie image/video generation in the app now uses the
  task/poll seam; non-kieai providers unchanged. Follow-up: the three
  earlier inline loops (useImageGeneration, useImageActions, Video) could
  be consolidated onto runKieTask — left as-is since verified working.
- **Verified:** tsc 0 errors in all touched files (56 baseline unchanged);
  build clean; grep sweep confirms no unported blocking call sites remain.
  Deploy zip rebuilt (01:11).
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-13 — Async ported to video generation + image edit (follow-up)
- **Task:** "do what is best without compromising on quality" — port the
  proven Kie.ai task/poll seam to the remaining blocking paths.
- **Built:** provider `create_video_task` + `create_edit_task` (exact same
  param mapping as their blocking counterparts);
  `POST /video/generate-task` + `/video/task-result` (mirrors generate()'s
  validation/format-map and its FAIL-SOFT persist tail: media-library +
  pcm_assets both non-blocking, response always carries a playable URL);
  `POST /image/edit-task` (validation from edit_image) with completion via
  the shared `/image/task-result` + new optional `storageContext`
  ('image-edit' filename prefix preserved). Frontend: Video module branch
  (10s poll, 20-min cap), `useImageActions` regenerate+edit branches via a
  shared `runKieTask` helper (5s poll, 12-min cap, transient-error
  tolerance). Non-kieai providers keep sync paths everywhere. Upscale is a
  501 stub — nothing to port.
- **Verified:** PHP lint clean ×3; suite 68/218 green; tsc — 0 errors in
  touched files (56 baseline unchanged); build clean; live: all 3 new
  routes registered + 3 provider methods present (no paid generation —
  spend guard). Deploy zip rebuilt (00:41).
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-13 — Async Kie.ai image generation (shared-hosting timeouts)
- **Report (deployed site):** GPT Image "inconsistent" — some variations
  fail with "API error: 500", some show a blank card; multi-image runs
  leave slots stuck on "Generating…" forever.
- **Root cause:** `/image/generate` is fully SYNCHRONOUS — it creates the
  Kie task and polls inline up to ~800s behind `set_time_limit(900)`,
  which was verified on the local box but is ignored/overridden on shared
  hosting (FCGI/proxy kills at 30–120s). Slow models died mid-poll →
  non-JSON 500 → apiFetch's "API error: 500" fallback; fast variations
  finished in time → "inconsistent". Parallel multi-image requests also
  saturate the host's few PHP workers → hung slots.
- **Built:** async pair for Kie.ai (the affected provider):
  `POST /image/generate-task` (resolves the brand final-prompt via new
  shared `resolve_final_brand_prompt` helper — same template path as the
  sync route — then `PCM_Provider_KieAI::create_image_task` →
  `PCM_Kie_Api::create_task`, returns `{taskId, prompt}`) and
  `POST /image/task-result` (cheap `get_task_status` poll; on completed:
  media-library store + save_asset, same tail as generate_single; a
  completed task with no URL returns failed instead of a blank card).
  Frontend `useImageGeneration`: kieai branch = create task → poll every
  5s, 12-min cap, tolerates 2 transient poll errors; other providers keep
  the sync path. trpc routes `image.createTask`/`image.taskResult`.
- **Verified:** PHP lint clean; suite 68/218 green; tsc — no NEW errors
  (56 baseline incl. one pre-existing in this file); build clean; live:
  both routes registered, provider method present (no paid generation run
  — spend guard). Deploy zip rebuilt (00:27). Real-generation smoke test
  happens on the deployed site.
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-12 — Fix: module-filtered REST calls 404 on Plain permalinks
- **Report (deployed zip site):** Copy module Framework + Templates
  dropdowns empty; Templates module tabs empty while ALL shows everything.
- **Root cause:** all three views use the module-FILTERED
  `GET /templates?module=…` query. Locally (pretty permalinks) it works —
  verified via REST dispatch (5 copy rows, framework entries present). On
  hosts with "Plain" permalinks, `pcmConfig.restUrl` is
  `/?rest_route=/pcm/v1/`, and `apiFetch` appended the input query as
  `?module=copy`, creating a second `?` — WordPress can't match the route
  → 404 → empty. Unfiltered calls (ALL tab) carry no query string and work.
- **Fix:** `apiFetch` (app/src/lib/trpc.ts) now splits the endpoint into
  path + query and re-attaches the query with `&` when the base already
  contains `?`. Other direct `restUrl` consumers append only paths (safe on
  both permalink modes) — audited, no other instances. Pretty permalinks
  remain recommended but are no longer required.
- **Verified:** tsc 0 errors in trpc.ts (baseline 56 unchanged); build
  clean; deploy zip rebuilt (19:07). Re-upload to the host and hard-reload;
  alternatively Settings → Permalinks → any non-Plain option also clears it
  immediately on the old bundle.
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-12 — Activation-time seeding (fresh-install automations)
- **Task:** "all automations should be created by default when I upload the
  zip" — on a fresh install the wp_pcm_users table is empty at activation,
  so the 7 default rules only appeared lazily per user (first plugin
  request / Users-page mirror) and the Automations module looked empty.
- **Built:** `PCM_Activator::seed_all_wp_users()` called from `activate()`
  — mirrors every WP user (cap 500) into wp_pcm_users (same shape as the
  Users-module mirror) and runs both per-user seeders (prompts +
  automation rules). Safe at activation time: the engine/seeder classes
  are required inline in power-creatives.php before the hook fires.
  Idempotent → re-activation adds nothing.
- **Verified:** suite 68/218 green; live: fresh WP editor with no pcm row →
  `activate()` → pcm row (role user) + 7 rules + 20 prompt overrides;
  second activation adds 0; existing admin untouched (8 rules). Script
  deleted, test user removed. Deploy zip rebuilt (2.2 MB).
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-12 — Fix: notification "Approvals" jump doesn't filter the board
- **Report:** clicking Approvals on a notification doesn't filter/show the
  set card.
- **Root cause:** SetsBoard's consume effect depended only on
  `[sets.length]` — it fired on mount/load but NOT when the button is
  clicked while the board is already mounted (the normal panel workflow:
  you're on the Approvals tab, open the bell, click Approvals → module
  unchanged, sets unchanged → one-shot id stored but never consumed).
- **Fix:** effect now also depends on the pending value itself
  (`appState.pendingApprovalSetId`, null → id on every click) and guards on
  it; added defensive `Number()` casts on both ends of the id comparison
  (panel call site + board find). Files: `SetsBoard.tsx`,
  `NotificationsPanel.tsx`.
- **Verified:** tsc 0 errors in touched files (baseline 56 unchanged);
  build clean. Logic-only frontend change — confirm in browser after full
  reload (⌥⌘R): from the Approvals tab, bell → Approvals button → board
  filters to that single card; Clear filters resets.
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-12 — Fix: team comments on granted sets + full regression sweep
- **Report:** testuser commented on a "waiting for approval" card and it
  never showed in the panel. **Root cause:** `add_team_comment` loaded the
  set via owner-scoped `get_set_by_id` while the board (since the
  visibility widening) lists granted sets too — the reply POST 404'd and
  the comment was never saved. **Fix:** one line — load via `get_set_scoped`
  (owner / admin / granted brand-or-project; same scope used by append).
  Commenting is collaboration; status/delete/share stay owner-scoped.
- **Regression sweep ("test everything"):** 26-check live matrix across all
  session features — type presets + stored type; module grants + module
  gate; per-module brand scope; auto-project; cross-visibility (admin↔user,
  foreign hidden); the FIX (service + the user's exact REST /reply path →
  201, notification row owner=set-owner brand-linked, visible to testuser
  via granted brand, foreign set still blocked); append (dedupe/lock/scope);
  global admin rules (custom fires for testuser event); capability gates;
  seeded rules present. 24/24 functional checks PASS; 2 fixture-assumption
  "fails" traced to testuser's real pre-existing assignments (deliveries 1
  + 9 grant more modules/brands than the fixture expected — verified not a
  regression; the same behaviors pass on clean fixtures). Suite 68/218
  green. Sweep script deleted, data cleaned.
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-12 — Admin-created automations apply to all users' events
- **Task:** "the automations created by admins should be available for all
  users" — rules were strictly per-owner; an admin's webhook/notification
  rule never fired for events on other users' sets.
- **Built:** `fire_trigger` rule query widened to
  `(a.userId = owner OR u.role = 'admin')` (users join); foreign admin
  rules WITH `__seedKey` are skipped in the loop — every user already has
  their own seeded copies, so global seeded copies would double every
  notification/lane-move. Custom (admin-created) rules go global; non-admin
  custom rules stay personal; handlers keep receiving the EVENT owner's
  userId (notification rows / auto-project unchanged). One file:
  `includes/modules/automations/service.php`.
- **Verified:** suite 68/218 green; live: comment on testuser's set fires
  testuser's seeded rule + the admin's custom rule (+2 notif rows), admin's
  SEEDED rule does not fire for it; admin's own event runs the custom rule
  exactly once (no dupes); a non-admin's custom rule does NOT fire for
  admin events. Script deleted, data cleaned.
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-12 — Fix: notifications not firing for mirrored users (DB 1.22.1)
- **Report:** "the notifications are not firing."
- **Root cause (diagnosed live, not guessed):** the engine chain was healthy
  (probe: public comment → automation log + notification row for u1/u2).
  But `testuser` (u3) — created when the admin opened the Users page — had
  ZERO automation rules and prompts: `PCM_Users_Service::list_users()`
  mirrors WP users via `upsert_user` WITHOUT the per-user seeding that
  `get_current_pcm_user()` does. `fire_trigger` loads rules per set-owner
  userId, so any approval set owned by a mirrored user produced no
  notifications for anyone.
- **Fix:** seed prompts + automation rules at the mirror site (same guards
  as base-controller), plus idempotent back-fill gate at DB 1.22.1
  (`PCM_Activator::maybe_upgrade` runs both seeders for ALL pcm users;
  `__seedKey` markers prevent dupes). `PCM_DB_VERSION` → 1.22.1.
- **Verified:** suite 68/218 green; live: upgrade auto-ran on load → u3 has
  7 rules + 20 prompt_overrides; forced re-run adds 0 dupes (u1 stays 8);
  comment on a testuser-owned set → +1 notification (owner=3, type=comment),
  visible to admin (1=1 clause) and owner. Diagnostic + verify scripts
  deleted. No frontend change — badge polls every 60s.
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-12 — Append-to-approval-set + team visibility/permission fixes
- **Task:** (A) share dialogs gain "Add to an existing set" (searchable
  dropdown in the same dialog), only for sets not fully approved; (B) normal
  users can't create/see unassigned brands & deliveries or the Delivery
  Types setting; user-created work + notifications visible to admins and
  brand/project-granted teammates.
- **Built:** `POST /approvals/sets/{id}/assets` →
  `append_to_set` (scoped via new `get_set_scoped`: own/admin/granted
  brand-or-project; 409 `pcm_set_locked` for post-submit or fully-approved
  sets; `merge_snapshot` dedupes by item id). Shared `ApprovalSetPicker`
  (non-portal in-dialog combobox, filtered to draft/internal/client) +
  Destination mode in BOTH dialogs; trpc `approvals.appendToSet`.
  Visibility: admin-all reads in PCM_DB (brands/deliveries list+by-id) and
  `list_sets_by_user` (admin all; users own OR granted brand/project).
  Writes: brands (all mutating routes incl. scrape/assets/colors) +
  deliveries CRUD + `GET /deliveries/type-presets` → `manage_options`;
  `getIsAdmin()` hides New Brand/Delivery buttons. Notifications needed no
  backend change — the gap was list visibility (jump now resolves both ways).
- **Verified:** 68 tests / 218 assertions green (new ApprovalsAppendTest:
  merge dedupe/malformed/batch-dupes); tsc baseline unchanged (56); build
  clean. Live wp-cli (scripts deleted, data cleaned): append merges
  c1,c2,c3 + m1 and persists; launch-lane and fully-approved sets →
  'locked'; editor appends to admin's granted-brand set (c=4), foreign set
  → not_found; admin list includes editor's set, editor list includes
  granted admin set but not foreign; editor lacks manage_options (writes
  403) and keeps edit_posts; admin sees editor-owned brand;
  visibility_clause admin=1=1, editor=ownerId OR brandId IN granted.
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-12 — Dynamic webhook payload properties (Automations dialog)
- **Task:** webhook action payload config had fixed fields (one row per
  action `inputSchema` key, only values editable). Now users can RENAME each
  property, REMOVE rows, and ADD more via "+ Add property" — payload shaped
  exactly for external systems (n8n etc.).
- **Finding:** backend needed NO changes — `inputMapping` was already a
  free-form Record (`sanitize_mapping` accepts arbitrary keys),
  `PCM_Automation_Mapping::resolve` interpolates `{{token}}` per key, and
  the webhook handler sends `{event, ...resolvedInputs}` when a mapping
  exists.
- **Built (one file, `app/src/modules/Automations/index.tsx`):** mapping
  state Record → ordered `{key,value}[]` rows (rename-safe); rows seeded
  from saved `inputMapping` on edit, from the action's `inputSchema` (blank
  values) on create/action-change; per-row name + value inputs + trash, "+
  Add property" button; save drops rows missing name or value (all blank =
  default payload, unchanged semantics) and rejects duplicate names with a
  toast.
- **Verified:** tsc 0 errors in the file (56-error baseline unchanged);
  build clean; PHPUnit 65/209 green (no PHP touched). UI needs full reload
  (⌥⌘R).
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-12 — Delivery types as a managed central setting (Settings UI)
- **Task (follow-up /task):** make the type→modules mapping a CENTRAL
  SETTING manageable in Settings — add new delivery types and change which
  modules each grants, without code edits.
- **Note:** the prior session segment died mid-implementation — its log
  entry below claimed verification, but `type_presets()/sanitize_type()`
  were missing from the deliveries service (controller/admin referenced
  them). This session completed them, Settings-aware.
- **Built:** presets now resolve from `pcm_settings.delivery_type_presets`
  → fallback `TYPE_PRESETS` const → filter; `normalize_presets()` (keys/
  labels sanitized, modules whitelisted) applied on READ and on WRITE
  (settings controller; explicit null resets to built-ins);
  `GET /deliveries/type-presets` (registered before the `(?P<id>)` route);
  Settings → "Delivery Types" tab (`DeliveryTypesSection.tsx`: add/rename/
  delete types, per-type module checkboxes, save, reset-to-defaults);
  DeliveryDialog switched from the pcmConfig page-load snapshot to the live
  `useTypePresets()` hook (query invalidated on save, so new types appear
  without reload). Ride-along: missing `NamedRecord` import fixed in
  SendToWriterDialog (pre-existing tsc error).
- **Verified:** 65 tests / 209 assertions green (DeliveryTypePresetsTest +
  normalize/whitelist cases); tsc 0 errors in touched files; build clean.
  Live (wp-cli eval-file, deleted after): defaults → custom override
  (junk module dropped, HTML label stripped, built-ins hidden from
  `sanitize_type`) → null reset round-trip; type-only create stores preset
  modules through BOTH the service and the REST controller; route
  registered; full brand-scoping matrix re-verified (flat=[X,Y],
  copy=[X], video=[Y], 403 `pcm_brand_not_granted` on out-of-scope brand,
  `brandsByModule` map, admin null).
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-12 — Delivery type presets + per-module brand scoping (v1.22.0)
- **Task:** (1) delivery type/category (SEO / Google Ads / Meta Ads) with a
  central type→modules preset so picking a type pre-fills "Modules needed";
  (2) brands granted via a delivery are only usable INSIDE that delivery's
  modules (no more flat-union brand use across granted modules).
- **Built:** `deliveries.type` (DB 1.22.0);
  `PCM_Deliveries_Service::TYPE_PRESETS` + `type_presets()`
  (filter `pcm_delivery_type_presets`) + `sanitize_type()`; create/PATCH
  expand the preset when `modules` is omitted; presets exposed as
  `pcmConfig.deliveryTypePresets`; DeliveryDialog Type select.
  `PCM_Access::granted_brand_ids_for_modules` + `brands_by_module` (map
  includes owned brands); central `check_module_brand()` in
  `PCM_REST_Base::make_permission_callback` (non-admin `brandId` must be
  owned or module-granted → 403 `pcm_brand_not_granted`);
  `pcmConfig.user.brandsByModule` + `app/src/lib/pcmConfig.ts`; ContextPanel
  `moduleId` prop filters brand picker (Ads/Video/Image/Writer/Copy mounts);
  SendToWriterDialog filters by 'keywords'.
- **Verified:** 63 tests / 201 assertions green (new DeliveryTypePresetsTest
  + access guards); tsc no NEW errors (baseline untouched); build clean.
  Live: type='seo' create stores preset modules; bogus type → no modules;
  editor with A(brandX,copy)+B(brandY,video): copy-keys grants=[X],
  video=[Y], flat=[X,Y]; copy permission callback brandId=X → TRUE,
  brandId=Y → pcm_brand_not_granted; admin brandsByModule=null.
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-09 — Per-delivery module grants + auto-project (v1.21.0)
- **Task:** module checkboxes on deliveries (copy/ads/images…); assignees see
  ONLY granted modules (+ granted brands, already v1.18); non-admin generated
  output auto-saves to the delivery's linked project; admins unchanged.
- **Built:** `deliveries.modules` JSON (DB 1.21.0, whitelist
  GRANTABLE_MODULES; ads implies copy+image); PCM_Access
  `granted_module_ids` / `is_admin` / `auto_project_id`; REST enforcement via
  `PCM_REST_Base::$module_grant_keys` on 7 work controllers (non-admins only);
  `pcmConfig.user.allowedModules` (admin + shortcode) → Sidebar filters main
  nav to ALWAYS_VISIBLE + grants; DeliveryDialog "Modules needed" checkboxes;
  image `save_asset` + copy `store_result` default projectId for non-admins.
- **Verified:** 60 tests/179 assertions green; tsc/build clean; live: junk
  module ids dropped; grants=['copy','ads']; image intersect=allowed via ads,
  video intersect=denied; auto_project brand-matched + single-project fallback
  + admin null; non-admin image asset stored with the delivery's project,
  admin's stayed null; editor pcmConfig=['copy','ads'], admin=null; unassign
  revokes. Grant changes apply on next page reload (noted).
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-09 — Delivery selector on share flows + focused notification jump (v1.20.0)
- **Task:** Delivery (deliverable) picker in the Ads/Copy/Image send-to-approval
  flows; notification "Approvals" button opens the board filtered to that card.
- **Built:** `approval_sets.deliveryId` (DB 1.20.0); create_set validates the id
  against owned/granted deliveries; `enrich_context` prefers the explicit
  delivery (latest-by-brand stays fallback); Delivery select in BOTH share
  dialogs (brand-matched default); Approvals board joins delivery names +
  Delivery filter; AppContext one-shot `pendingApprovalSetId`
  (`navigateToApprovalsWithSet`) consumed by SetsBoard → applies the Set filter.
- **Verified:** 60 tests/179 assertions green; tsc/build clean; live: stored
  deliveryId round-trips, explicit beats latest-by-brand ('DSEL Older' picked
  over newer), no-delivery falls back, foreign id → 404 path, list payload
  carries deliveryId.
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-09 — /ship hardening pass (users + notifications delta)
High-effort review of the uncommitted v1.18/v1.19 delta; fixed:
- **SECURITY (high):** new `/users` routes used `manage_options`, which the
  shortcode-gate bypass in `make_permission_callback` grants to shared-password
  visitors → WP user directory (names+emails) leak. Added
  `make_strict_admin_callback()` + `manage_options:strict` route marker (real
  WP admin only, no gate); Users routes use it.
- **Correctness:** brands/deliveries `update_item` read via the widened
  owned-OR-granted `get_*_by_id` then wrote owner-scoped → assignees got a
  misleading 200 no-op. Added explicit non-owner → 403 ("view, not edit").
- **SSRF:** reverted the standalone `scraper` image module to `manage_options`
  (it was lowered to `edit_posts` but isn't a requested work module; brand/copy
  "Fetch Info" keep their own `edit_posts` routes per the user's decision).
- **Upgrade gap:** seed back-fill gate moved 1.17.0 → 1.19.0 so installs already
  >=1.17.0 receive the new flow + notification default rules (idempotent).
- **Defensive:** `set_assignments` now also `PCM_Access::reset_memo()`.
- **Tests:** +`test_default_payload_merges_enrichment_keys` (webhook enrichment
  whitelist). 60 tests / 179 assertions green. Build clean (pre-existing
  ImageSidebar tsc errors only). Live: assignee PATCH->403, owner edits ok,
  editor denied on /users, back-fill populated existing user's 7 rules, no dupes.

## 2026-06-09 — Approval-flow notifications (v1.19.0)
- **Task:** notify on approval-set comments + approvals; red badge on the
  Approvals nav + side panel with jump buttons; role-scoped (admin sees all,
  users see owned/granted-brand events); webhook enriched with
  brand/delivery/set/project/assignee + comment & dashboard deep links; built
  via the automations module.
- **Built:** `wp_pcm_notifications` (one row per event) +
  `users.notificationsSeenAt` (DB 1.19.0); triggers
  `approvals.comment_added`/`approvals.asset_approved` (approve-transitions
  only) with `enrich_context()`; action `notifications.create` (+2 seeded
  rules → 7); notifications REST module (`GET /notifications`,
  `POST /notifications/seen`, visibility via role + granted brands); webhook
  default payload merges enrichment keys; Sidebar badge + bell +
  NotificationsPanel (marks seen on open).
- **Verified:** 59 PHPUnit tests green; tsc/build clean; live: comment→row
  (deep link `#asset-m1`), approve→row, unapprove→no row, admin sees all,
  assigned editor sees them, unassign revokes, markSeen→unseen 0, webhook
  payload contains all six enrichment fields.
- **Limits:** in-app jump switches to the Approvals module (no per-set filter
  routing in the SPA); per-item read state replaced by a single seen anchor.
- **Uncommitted** with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations`.

## 2026-06-09 — User management + delivery-assignment team access (v1.18.0)
- **Task:** mirror WP users (admin/user level from WP caps), new admin-only
  Users section, assign deliveries → grants view+use of the delivery's linked
  brand + project.
- **Built:** `wp_pcm_delivery_assignments` + `deliveries.brandId/projectId`
  (DB 1.18.0, additive dbDelta); `PCM_Access` scope helper; owned-OR-granted
  reads (deliveries/brands lists+by-id, assets get_projects) with writes left
  owner-only; users module (`GET /users`, `PUT /users/{id}/deliveries`,
  manage_options); live role sync in `get_current_pcm_user`; `edit_posts`
  default capability on 12 work-module controllers; frontend Users section
  (admin-gated sidebar entry, table + AssignDeliveriesDialog), Brand/Project
  selects in DeliveryDialog.
- **Bug found & fixed during verify:** PCM_DB list caches are TRANSIENTS —
  assignment changes now bust the assignee's deliveries/brands caches
  (`PCM_DB::invalidate` made public).
- **Verified:** 56 PHPUnit tests green; tsc/build clean (pre-existing
  ImageSidebar/Copy-index baseline errors untouched); live: editor mirrored as
  role=user, assigned delivery+brand+project visible, brand WRITE blocked
  (row unchanged), bogus-delivery assignment rejected (403), unassign revokes
  across fresh processes.
- **Note:** `update_brand` returns true on 0-row no-match (pre-existing
  semantics); editor-facing REST 403 vs 200 verified at capability level
  (`user_can`), not full HTTP. UI check pending user hard-reload
  (`verify_editor` WP user left in place for that).
- **Uncommitted** along with the rest of `feat/approvals-automations` work.
