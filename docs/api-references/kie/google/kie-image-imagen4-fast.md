## Query Task Status

After submitting a task, use the unified query endpoint to check progress and retrieve results:

  Learn how to query task status and retrieve generation results
</Card>

<Tip>
  For production use, we recommend using the `callBackUrl` parameter to receive automatic notifications when generation completes, rather than polling the status endpoint.

                    - Must be `google/imagen4-fast` for this endpoint
                  example: google/imagen4-fast
                callBackUrl:

                    The URL to receive generation task completion updates.
                    Optional but recommended for production use.


                    - System will POST task status and results to this URL when
                    generation completes

                    - Callback includes generated content URLs and task
                    information

                    - Your callback endpoint should accept POST requests with
                    JSON payload containing results

                    - Alternatively, use the Get Task Details endpoint to poll
                    task status

                        is a young woman with brightly dyed pink hair (slightly
                        faded) and freckled skin, looking directly and intently
                        into the camera lens with a hopeful yet slightly
                        uncertain smile. She wears an oversized, vintage band
                        t-shirt (slightly worn, with the faintly cracked white
                        text “KIE AI” across the chest) layered over a
                        long-sleeved striped top, along with simple silver stud
                        earrings. The lighting is soft, golden hour sunlight
                        streaming through a slightly dusty window, creating lens
                        flare and illuminating dust motes in the air. The
                        background shows a blurred, cluttered bedroom with
                        posters on the wall and fairy lights, rendered with a
                        shallow depth of field. Natural film grain, a warm,
                        slightly muted color palette, and sharp focus on her
                        expressive eyes enhance the intimate, authentic feel.
